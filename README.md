# Cybershuttle Reference Example
# ðŸ‘‹ Hello Cybershuttle

Welcome to **Cybershuttle Reference Example**, a minimal reference example for getting started with [Cybershuttle](https://cybershuttle.org), a framework that bridges your local interactive computing environment with powerful remote computational infrastructure.

This repository demonstrates how to:
- Configure a project for Cybershuttle
- Run code locally and remotely with minimal friction
- Transfer input/output data between local and remote systems
- Track job status and retrieve results efficiently

> Whether you're running a machine learning model or a scientific simulation, this example helps you get productive quickly using best practices in reproducible, distributed computing.
